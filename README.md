Hi there👋, welcome to my GitHub page, look at my repositories and be wowed😂.
Here's my coding journey in ascending order: first is from information page, next is frontend development with Laravel framework. Then an ecommerce site - a Backend development within Web Applications development with Laravel/Lumen, followed by more lumen refactoring codebase, yay 😂.
Then I tried my hands on some open source contribution as an outreachy applicant (didn't pan out there, no problem) with Mbaolab and Ceph storage (hmm, that was fun)
From there I dived deep into C++, from beginners to advanced, yeah, from semantics to modularization and containerization with the repos C20 Masterclass source code, C_initials and Tic Tac Toe.
What's next, let me think🤔, yeah I delved into Game Development from there, 2D Monster Chase Game in C#, Match-3 game development with C# all with Unity Engine.
Now, I'm working on creating interactive web audio with Tone.js showcasing unique Nigerian culture and experiences, yay.

Haa, that's all for now, join me on my journey as I keep doing things, ask me questions on each of them (I did them, I might not be able to remember completely but I can touch on them all). 
Okay bye for now, Chao👋
